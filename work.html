                <p>researcher within professors julia kramer & sita syal's colab 'ember - edge colab', and explored how justice is being discussed and acheived in the field of design.
                this consited of: conducting thematic analysis to find themes of justice in engineering design, connecting data to other work within field and outside of engineering
                ,writing analyses of themes relating justice to engineering design, searching for additional papers in other academic journals and conduct qualitative coding, and assist with academic paper writing.
                </p>
                <p>as mentioned, i am currently working on this. we hope to have a paper by the end of the summer containing our findings and i can't wait to share!</p>

                 <p>working with a team, we created a wearable device that dampens a user's voice up to 20db. it utilizied active and passive noise
                    cancelling technologies, in combination with live audio monitoring and playback, to give a user maximum sound attenuation while practing
                    singing, talking, or taking private phonecalls. this project was born from michigan's desci 501 - analytical product design course, where we learned the 
                    phases of traditional design processes, starting from customer discovey and ending with creating a full fledge business plan. see our full portfolio
